## Prepare the environment

You can use PDM to install this project quickly.

If you want to run it on CPU, you must remove this in `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
# remove this 
[[tool.pdm.source]]
name = "pytorch-cuda"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118"
include_packages = ["torch","torchaudio","torchvision"]
exclude_packages = ["*"]
```

<details><summary> Linux</summary>

```
pdm install
```

</details>

<details><summary>Windos</summary>


```
pdm install
```
